Ten suggestions for creating an inviting, nurturing environment for women in
the discipline of computer science:

<ul><li>Address female students by name as often as men are addressed by name</li></ul>
<ul><li>Establish eye contact equally with men and women</li></ul>
<ul><li>Avoid gesturing more often when men respond to questions or make
comments</li></ul>
<ul><li>Refrain from interrupting female students more often than males</li></ul>
<ul><li>Allow women as much time to answer questions as the men are allowed</li></ul>
<ul><li>In those instances when a woman can't answer a question, do not
regularly go to a man with the assumption of getting the correct answer</li></ul>
<ul><li>Offer hands-on experience and spend time teaching the basic to reduce
anxiety throughout</li></ul>
<ul><li>Explain the relevance of labs, assignments and lecture material to
other areas or disciplines</li></ul>
<ul><li>Discuss issues involving the ethics of programming</li></ul>
<ul><li>Emphasize the positive social benefits of computing</li></ul>
