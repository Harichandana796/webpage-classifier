Recommendations for recruiting women to Graduate CSE Programs:
<ul><li>Broaden the recruitment pool beyond students with undergraduate CSE
majors</li></ul>
<ul><li>Broaden the criteria used in admission and be flexible in their
application</li></ul>
<ul><li>Encourage reentry students</li></ul>
<ul><li>Provide bridging opportunities to entering graduate students</li></ul>
<ul><li>Explicitly include diversity considerations in your admissions process</li></ul>
<ul><li>Be proactive in making recruiting contacts</li></ul>
<ul><li>Review all departmental publications for both text and images
containing overt or subtle message that might discourage women from applying</li></ul>
<ul><li>Inform your undergraduates about the opportunities and rewards of a
research career, giving them timely information about appropriate preparation
for such a career</li></ul>
<ul><li>Provide undergraduate women with exposure to computing research.
Students who have had hands-on experience with computing research as
undergraduates are more likely to apply to graduate school</li></ul>
<ul><li>Give individual encouragement to your women undergraduates</li></ul>
<ul><li>Actively counter negative stereotypes and misperceptions of computer
science and engineering</li></ul>
<br/><br/>

Recommendations for retaining women through Graduation:
<ul><li>Be diligent at mentoring women graduate students</li></ul>
<ul><li>Help to create a peer community for your women students</li></ul>
<ul><li>Broaden the institutional culture of the department to accept a range of
personal choices in balancing work and life</li></ul>
<ul><li>Provide women role models</li></ul>
<ul><li>Integrate students into the research culture of the department as early
as possible</li></ul>
<ul><li>Help women graduate students become involved in the professional
community as well as the departmental community</li></ul>
<ul><li>Standardize the methods your department uses for delivering
information, so that students do not have to be part of an informal social
network to receive it</li></ul>
<ul><li>Change the departmental infrastructure to better promote the equal
participation of women</li></ul>
