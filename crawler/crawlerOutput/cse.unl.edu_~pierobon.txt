<p align="justify" class="plaintext">Dr. Pierobon is currently an Assistant Professor with the <a href="http://www.cse.unl.edu" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science &amp;amp Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.unl.edu">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>. Dr. Pierobon holds also a courtesy appointment at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, effective from September 2014. He received the BWN Lab Researcher of the Year Award at the Georgia Institute of Technology for his outstanding research achievements in 2011. He was also named IEEE Communications Letters 2013 Exemplary Reviewer in appreciation for his service as referee. He is a member of IEEE, ACM, and ACS. He is in the <a href="http://host.comsoc.org/transcom/board.html" target="_blank">Editorial board of IEEE Transactions on Communications</a>, in the Area of Modulation &amp; Signal Design, with the following designation: Biochemical and Molecular Communications. His current <a href="./research.html" target="_blank">research interests</a> are in molecular communication theory for nanonetworks, communication engineering applied to intelligent drug delivery systems, and biological circuit network engineering.</p>
<p align="justify" class="plaintext">Massimiliano Pierobon received the Master of Science (B.S.+M.S.) degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2005. During 2006, Massimiliano Pierobon worked as a researcher in the R &amp;amp D department of Siemens Carrier Networks, Milan, where he coauthored two filed patents on jitter buffer management. From January 2007 to July 2009 he was a graduate research assistant at the Politecnico di Milano in the fields of signal processing and pattern recognition. In November 2008 Massimiliano Pierobon joined the BWN lab, first as a visiting researcher and, from August 2009, as a Ph.D. student. He received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the <a href="http://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>, Atlanta, GA, in August 2013, under the guidance of Professor <a href="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/bwn/IFA/index.html" target="_blank">Ian F.
