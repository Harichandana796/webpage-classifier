  My research has a common thread of leveraging resources in software code repositories to better support programmers. In the past, the primary target of my approaches has been end-user programmers, with techniques that aim to increase the quality of programs (i.e., through refactoring [ICSE 2011]) or to help programmers find code that solves a particular problem (i.e., semantic search with lightweight specifications [FSE NIER 2012, ICSE Doctoral Symposium 2012]). More recently we are taking the semantic search approach to a broader audience, targeting more mainstream programming languages like SQL and Java. These techniques have been evaluated using different empirical methods, including crowdsourcing, which can enable large-scale and cost-effective evaluation [ESEM 2010]. 
  </p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of programmers and their communities, I have also conducted several exploratory empirical studies (i.e., on duplication in Yahoo! Pipes [ESEM 2011], on programming language usage in Kodu [SIGCSE 2011], on copy/paste behaviors [VL/HCC 2009]). 
  <!--
My research focuses on software engineering for end users, and I aim to enable end users to create dependable 
programs by bringing the benefits of software engineering to the growing community of end users.  
I approach this problem by creating tools and techniques that promote community-based collaborations 
among users, allow users to learn from the experiences and expertise of others, 
and provide dependability support for user tasks.

Related to computer science education,
I have contributed to an online instructional tool, <a href="http://esquared.unl.edu/BugHunt">BugHunt</a>, 
that teaches software testing techniques through a series of tutorials. I have also held an internship at the
Microsoft FUSE Labs and studied <a href="http://fuse.microsoft.com/project/kodu.aspx">Kodu</a>, an educational
programming language designed for children.
