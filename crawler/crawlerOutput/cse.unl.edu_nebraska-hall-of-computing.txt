<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-summary"> <div class="field-content"> <p>In recognition of her research and fundamental contributions in the modeling and analysis of telecommunications and computer systems leading to world-class performance of the global AT&amp;T network for which she was named an AT&amp;T Fellow (the first woman to receive AT&amp;T’s highest technical honor), her leadership in AT&amp;T Labs in building a world renowned team in the areas of teletraffic theory, performance analysis and network design, for her leadership of the AT&amp;T Labs program that provided financial and mentoring support to women and minorities pursuing doctorates in the sciences and engineering for which this program was awarded the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, and her dedication to personally mentoring and nurturing younger colleagues in technical disciplines, the University of Nebraska proudly inducts Nebraska native and outstanding UNL alumna Dr Patricia E. Wirth into the Nebraska Hall of Computing.</p> </div> </div>
<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-bio"> <div class="field-content"> <p>Patricia Wirth grew up on a farm outside Nebraska City where an outstanding high school teacher sparked her love for mathematics. After receiving a four year Regents scholarship she earned a B.A. degree in mathematics in three years with honors from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1971. In her first job after college she worked as a statistical research assistant at the Washington University School of Medicine studying innovative forms of health care delivery. She received the M.S. and D.Sc. degrees in Systems Science and Mathematics from Washington University in St. Louis in 1978 and 1981 respectively.</p>
<p>In 1981 Pat joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories as a Member of Technical Staff until 1985 when she became a Technical Manager supervising performance modeling of AT&amp;T’s new 5ESS Switch, the first fully software controlled network switching element. In 1990 she was promoted to Head of the Department of Teletraffic Theory and System Performance. She led this evolving department that grew to over 50 experts chartered to assess and improve the performance of AT&amp;T's networks, products and services until her retirement in 2005. During this period she championed a company wide initiative to apply Software Architecture Reviews to all new significant software systems utilizing independent experts from within the company over a multi- day effort. This program led to significant improvements of major software systems meeting their business mission. The paper (co-authored) describing these experiences was named among IEEE Software's 25th Anniversary Thirty-Five Top Picks out of the 1200 peer reviewed full- length articles it had published through 2008.</p>
<p>With the rapid growth of the global Internet in the mid-90s and the opportunity it presented for AT&amp;T as a growth business, Pat moved the major focus of her team. Contributions included the first end-to-end performance modeling of internet based services and associated actual measurable network metrics gathered in real time that alerted when customers were impacted. This work helped AT&amp;T enter into contractual arrangements with clear boundaries and associated measures of quality including penalties with major corporate clients that shared portions of the delivered service. Within AT&amp;T it also helped grow a large new business as a major internet backbone provider and as a provider of contractual services branded and provided by third parties.

<strong>George Nagy</strong> was born in Budapest in 1937. After WWII, a chance meeting between his
                        father and a friend resulted in the family’s migration to Canada instead of Australia. He graduated
                        in Engineering Physics from McGill University in 1959. On completing the MS at McGill and the PhD
                        at Cornell, he joined IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center, where he was assigned to work on Chinese
                        character recognition because all the Chinese scientists were busy with Cyrillic OCR. He tells what
                        brought him to Nebraska:

                     </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“During the summer of 1966, I was chopping rats at Cornell University. Frank Rosenblatt, who had
                           been my thesis advisor five years earlier and whose interests had shifted from perceptron models
                           of cognition to neurochemical experiments, was attempting to understand and confirm the recently
                           reported transfer of learning through brain extracts in worms and rats. I was assisting in the
                           extraction of synaptic end-bulb substance from the cortex of rats trained to run a maze while
                           waiting for the accumulation of the statistical data that Frank had invited me to analyze.</p>
<p>In Frank’s absence, I frequently showed visitors through the lab. One visitor interested in learning
                           more about neural networks was Don Nelson, director of the computing center of the University
                           of Nebraska. After some discussion of brain models and my work at IBM on pattern recognition,
                           he invited me to give two or three weeks of lectures to his staff — before the rise of computer
                           science departments, many computing centers had a strong research orientation. Impressed by Don’s
                           enthusiasm and wide knowledge, I set to work in the fall to prepare the material for the lectures.
                           Already aware that most of the basic algorithms in pattern recognition and image processing were
                           being continuously reinvented with perspectives from statistics, linear algebra, switching theory,
                           combinatorics, control theory, and psychology, I programmed and illustrated each algorithm with
                           the same example. I also read eclectically, and collected experimental applications. The lectures
                           were well received, so immediately after my return I compiled my notes and submitted the material
                           to the<em>Proceedings of the IEEE</em>. This article not only became a Citation Classic, but next
                           year, while on leave from IBM with the departments of <em>informatique</em> and of <em>neurophysiologie</em>                           at the Université de Montréal, my notes passed the trial by fire in a graduate course.
                        </p>
<p>The first visit led to another invitation to Lincoln five years later. On the basis of that first
                           agreeable experience, and impressed by the department’s talented young faculty and UNL’s exceptional
                           computing facilities, I eagerly accepted the chairmanship of the University of Nebraska Department
                           of Computer Science in 1972. One thing that I recall learning quickly was that at conferences
                           in those years, recruiting committees had to queue up at the tables of the few available computer
                           science faculty candidates!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At UNL Nagy coauthored conference papers and journal articles with more than a half dozen faculty and
                        many students. In 1985, the declining health of aging parents prompted the family’s return to the
                        East Coast. Since then, he has been Professor of Computer Engineering at RPI where he teaches pattern
                        recognition, probability, and digital design. He participates in research projects with former UNL
                        colleagues, keeps in touch with several Nebraska students (a few of whom have already retired), and
                        enjoys introducing new graduate students from around the world to the joys and frustrations of research
                        (23 PhDs to date). He is a Fellow of the IEEE and of the International Association for Pattern Recognition,
                        and received a Lifetime Contributions award from the document analysis community. In his spare time
                        he enjoys skiing, sailing, and writing prolix surveys.</p>

                           of advanced microprocessors, the Java programming language and the Internet.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional corporate research managers, Sutherland added individuals from fields like psychology,
                           cognitive science, and anthropology to enhance the work of his technology staff. He also directed
                           his scientists to take their research, like the Xerox Alto "personal" computer, outside of the
                           lab to allow people to use it in a corporate setting and to observe their interaction with it.</p>
<p>In addition, Sutherland fostered a collaboration between the Caltech researchers who simplified the
                           design of very large-scale integrated circuits (VLSI) -- his brother Ivan and Carver Mead -- and
                           Lynn Conway of his PARC staff. With PARC resources made available by Bert, Mead and Conway developed
                           a textbook and university syllabus that helped expedite the development and distribution of integrated
                           circuit design technology whose impact is now immeasurable.
                           <br/> Sutherland said that a research lab is primarily a teaching institution, "teaching whatever is
                           new so that the new can become familiar, old, and used widely.</p>
<p>Sutherland received his Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
                           (1957), and his Master's Degree and Ph.D. from MIT (1963,1966); his PhD thesis advisor was Claude
                           Shannon. During his military service as a carrier pilot in the United States Navy (1957-62), he
                           was awarded the Legion of Merit as a Carrier Anti Submarine Warfare plane commander.</p> </div> </div>

<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-summary"> <div class="field-content"> <p>In recognition of his pioneering work on high speed computational science and systems rooted in cryptography problems during World War II, his leadership and foresight in building a team of computer professionals skilled in both the engineering and marketing trade-offs necessary for successful product development including the first supercomputers, his recognition of the importance of Computer Aided Instruction (PLATO) and education for all levels of our society, his commitment to the development of inner-city jobs, and his forward-looking management style that led to the successful spin off of more than thirty enterprises, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln proudly inducts William C. Norris into the Nebraska Hall of Computing.</p> </div> </div>
<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-bio"> <div class="field-content"> <p><span>William C. Norris</span> was born near Red Cloud, Nebraska, on July 14th, 1911. He was raised on a farm on the Republican River in south central Nebraska. He and his two sisters, including twin sister Willa who later taught at Michigan State University, attended a one-room schoolhouse where their mother had been the first grade teacher. He attended the University of Nebraska –Lincoln to study Electrical Engineering and graduated in 1932.  Shortly before his graduation, his father died suddenly and Norris returned home to help save the family farm in the midst of the depression.</p>
<p>He worked as a salesman for Westinghouse Electric for seven years until he left to work for the US Navy, where he rose to the rank of commander. In the Navy, he worked on intelligence problems related to the Enigma machine of the Germans and contributed to the breaking of that code. In Washington, he met and Married Jane Malley, a WAVES officer, with whom he would have eight children.</p>
<p>After the war, he co-founded Engineering Research Associates, Inc., in St. Paul, Minnesota. ERA made contributions to the development of digital computer technology, and later merged with Sperry Rand Corporation. Norris headed the Univac Division of Sperry Rand before leaving to found the Control Data Corporation.</p>
<p>Control Data started by selling magnetic drum memory systems to other computer manufacturers, but introduced their own mainframe, the CDC 1604, in 1958. The 1604 was primarily designed by Seymour Cray and the company soon followed with a series of increasingly powerful machines beginning with the CDC 3600. In 1965, they introduced the CDC 6600 which by all rights can be called the first supercomputer. The series of machines were very popular in research universities and government laboratories. As a result CDC, which had gone public, was suddenly the darling of Wall Street and in an envious leadership position with a machine ten times as fast as anything else on the market.</p>
<p>Norris was among the first to recognize the importance of scientific computing and he had the vision to create the fastest computers in the world. He knew from his Navy contacts that such machines were needed. In that effort, he became famous for taking on IBM, which, at the time, was somewhat distant from the need for and possibilities of large scale computational science machines.</p>
<p>He was also early and instrumental in convincing the country of the need to hasten the development of the use of computers in education. That vision led CDC to build PLATO, the first computer-aided instruction system. Using PLATO, the University of Illinois built an automated foreign language lab that set the standard for years to come of what could be done in this area. Other PLATO pioneers built “dry labs” that realistically reproduced the effects of traditional wet labs at a significantly lower cost of instruction. The logic and philosophy behind these learning units are easily recognized in many of today’s automated teaching units.</p>
<p>Norris was also an industry maverick who built on Control Data's expansion in the late 1960s to bring jobs and training to inner-cities and disadvantaged communities. He argued long and hard that other industry leaders should follow his example and bring up the work capabilities of our undereducated population. He became a champion of moving factories into the inner-cities, providing stable incomes and "high-tech" training to thousands of people who would otherwise have little chance at either.</p>
<p>The CDC 6600 was such a significant threat to IBM’s business, that they quickly started a project of their own to grab the performance crown back from CDC and for the first time pre-announced an advanced Systems 360 that was promised to be faster than the 6600. The machine didn't yet exist and CDC carefully documented sales CDC lost to the unfinished IBM project.  In 1968, Norris launched an anti-trust lawsuit against IBM, which was unable to deliver on its promise of a faster machine, and CDC was awarded $600 million in damages. Norris was a hero to all those who suffered under IBM’s marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Norris continually purchased new companies to fold into CDC, and eventually returned to the peripheral market in the 1970s. This later move proved particularly wise. It was also during the 1970s that Cray left to form his own company, and quickly drove CDC out of its leadership position in the supercomputer market. This left CDC in second place in a market for a small number of machines. Soon large Japanese companies were gobbling up what Cray didn't. CDC tried to regain its footing in the supercomputer market by spinning off ETA Systems, in order to allow the developers to escape an increasingly difficult management structure inside CDC. This effort failed however and CDC gave up on the market entirely.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, CDC was left primarily as a hard disk manufacturer and CDC’s manufacturing facilities included plants in Lincoln and in Omaha.  Their series of SCSI drives were particularly successful. CDC morphed into Ceridian which was first headed up by another UNL graduate Jim Ousley and today has gown to be a multi-billion dollar enterprise.</p>
<p>Norris died on August 21 2006 in Bloomington Minnesota. The list of companies spun off from CDC over the years exceeds 30 and many still exist today with capital value exceeding many billions of dollars. Much of this success can be credited to Norris, who, though not educated in business and not subscribing to many of the then-held sacred cows of a successful business venture, gave rise to success that can only be measured by the return from hard work and diligent thinking that he brought with him from a Nebraska farm and a University of Nebraska education.</p>

<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-summary"> <div class="field-content"> <p>In recognition of his pioneering accomplishments in the field of feedback control systems, his key role in the design and implementation of the Whirlwind digital computer, and his foundational work in systems dynamics, coupled with his dedication to teaching which continued into his nineties, and his nationally and internationally recognized efforts to continuously improve computer science and engineering, systems science, and computational management, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln proudly inducts <strong>Dr. Jay W. Forrester</strong> into the Nebraska Hall of Computing.</p> </div> </div>
<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-bio"> <div class="field-content"> <p><strong>Jay W. Forrester</strong> was born and educated in Nebraska. He is a pioneer computer engineer and systems scientist. Neither field existed when he first attended UNL in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Born on a cattle ranch  near Anselmo, Nebraska in 1918, he recently celebrated his 90th birthday. In high school, he built a wind-driven, 12-volt electrical system using old car parts, which gave the ranch its first electric power. He had long decided to attend the University of Nebraska – Lincoln and had a scholarship to the Agriculture College, but decided to major in electrical engineering. He graduated in 1939 with distinction and served in the Army ROTC on campus. As he tells his own story:</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 1.1em 30px;">I grew up on a cattle ranch in Nebraska in the middle of the United States. A ranch is a cross-roads of economic forces. Supply and demand, changing prices and costs, and economic pressures of agriculture become a very personal, powerful, and dominating part of life. Furthermore, in an agricultural setting, life must be very practical. It is not theoretical; it is not conceptual without purpose. One works to get results. It is full-time immersion in the real world. In high school, I built a wind-driven electric plant that provided our first electricity. That was a very practical activity. When I finished high school, I had received a scholarship to go to the Agricultural College [at UNL] when one of those important turning points intervened. Three weeks before enrolling at the Agricultural College, I decided it wasn't for me. Herding cattle in Nebraska winter blizzards never had appealed to me. So instead, I enrolled in the Engineering College at the University of Nebraska. Electrical engineering, as it turns out, was about the only academic field with a solid, central core of theoretical dynamics. And so, the road to the present began.</blockquote>
<p>Upon graduation, Forrester went to graduate school at MIT and worked under Gordon Brown, who had just taken a position as a faculty member and who a year later founded the Servomechanisms Laboratory. This laboratory did pioneering research into control systems for machines, which led to the automatic fire-control and aiming systems used during the Second World War.</p>
<p>This early work in feedback control systems was extremely practical and his knowledge led to being a support engineer for the experimental units installed on the USS Lexington. When they stopped working, he volunteered to go to Pearl Harbor in 1942. He fixed the problem as the ship sailed off-shore during the invasion of Tarawa.  He tells of that harrowing experience with the voice of a Nebraska rancher:</p>
<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 1.1em 30px;">Having discovered the problem [with the faulty system], but not having time to fix it, the executive officer of the ship came to me and said they were about to leave port. He asked if I would like to come with them and finish my job? So I said "Yes," having no idea quite what that meant. We were off-shore during the invasion of Tarawa and then took a turn down through the middle between the Sunrise and Sunset chains of the Marshall Islands. The islands were occupied on both sides by Japanese fighter-plane bases and they didn't like having a U.S. Navy Task Force wrecking their airports. So they kept trying to sink our ships. After dark they dropped flares along one side of the task force and come in with torpedo planes from the other side. Finally at 11 p.m. they succeeded in hitting the Lexington, cutting off one of the four propellers and setting the rudder in a hard turn. Again, it gave a very practical view of how research and theory are related to the field application.</blockquote>
<p>Together with other members of the lab, they were involved in the development of Whirlwind, the first all-digital computer.  As a part of the Whirlwind project, Forrester invented and patented coincident-current random-access magnetic core memory.  The Whirlwind work eventually became a component of SAGE  (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) which became the  air defense system for North America. Forrester continued his research in electrical and computer engineering until 1956.</p>
<p>He then left engineering to pursue the study and exploitation of Systems Dynamics, which he wisely felt had a great role to play in large organizations wrestling with complex interrelated sub-systems.  He moved to the MIT Sloan School of Management MIT, where he is currently the Germeshausen Professor Emeritus and Senior Lecturer. Forrester’s work in systems dynamics was so extensive that today he is recognized as the creator of this important field.</p>
<p>Throughout his lifetime he has earned much recognition and received many awards including the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award and in 1989 he received the National Medal of Technology.  In 2006 he was inducted into the Operational Research Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Forrester says: "We grow good people in our Nebraska small towns, with honesty, sincerity and hard work as their byword it is no wonder they succeed."</p>

<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-summary"> <div class="field-content"> <p>In recognition of his outstanding accomplishments in the field of computer science and engineering, his dedication working with students and faculty from almost every discipline of the university, his efforts to continuously improve computing infrastructure, his work to advance understanding of computational algorithms of high importance and complexity, and his entrepreneurial spirit as co-founder of the Institute for Computational Science, Co-Director of Center for Communication and Information, Director of Research Computing Group, founder of i2rd, and inspiration of many other spin-offs, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln proudly inducts <strong>Dr. Don J. Nelson</strong> into the Nebraska Hall of Computing.</p> </div> </div>
<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-bio"> <div class="field-content"> <p><strong>Don J. Nelson</strong> was born on a farm near Pilger, Nebraska, on August 17, 1930.  He attended District #50, a one-room country school house, through eighth grade and graduated from Pilger High School in 1948.  He attended the University of Nebraska and received his Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.  He served as a member of the Technical Staff at Bell Labs in New York City and then entered active duty as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>During his military service, Nelson taught delivery of special weapons (atomic). He also designed and developed a trainer and textbook for pilots attending flight school at Sandia Air Force Base.  He returned to the University of Nebraska and received his Master's degree in Electrical Engineering.  He received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University and returned to Nebraska, retiring in 2005 after 50 years at UNL.</p>
<p>As a graduate student, Nelson built the first Electronic Analog Computer (UNEBAC) for the University of Nebraska.  He was subsequently asked to serve as Director of the UNL Computing Center, which eventually grew to employ over 100 experts in computational science and served as the university's center for hardware and software support in the early days of computer usage.  Development of the university's computational core required financing to hire the best and brightest analysts and computer programmers.</p>
<p>Nelson and his staff at the Computing Center put the Nebraska State Laws online into machine-readable form and designed and supervised the development of a Law Information Retrieval Program for the College of Law.  Later, Nelson designed and supervised the development of the Bill Drafting System for the Nebraska State Legislature.</p>
<p>Faculty from every discipline looked to the Computing Center staff for assistance in development and programming for their research projects.  Funding for services from both inside and outside the university secured the Center's growth and facilitated its rise to prominence when computer expertise was scarce among universities nationwide.</p>
<p>Nelson developed a Remote Job Entry System (NUROS) that allowed students and faculty researchers to obtain online access from their labs and offices.  These NUROS terminals were able to communicate with the Computing Center and have computational access and services, whether from the Press Box at Memorial Stadium or from London, England.</p>
<p>During the rapid growth of the computer age, Nelson co-founded the Institute for Computational Sciences, which later became the Department of Computer Science.  After he left the UNL Computing Center and the Institute, he continued his work using computer programming to find solutions.  Committed to helping Nebraska industry, Nelson developed a simulation of the operation of the NPPD nuclear plant at Brownville, Nebraska, which allowed the safest and most optimum use of their nuclear resources.</p>
<p>Nelson also designed and developed a simulation program for the U.S. Army, the Mobile Systems Equipment program, which simulated battlefield operations.  The system was later employed during Desert Storm and performed "in an exceptional manner" according to military sources.</p>
<p>Nelson continued to teach undergraduate and graduate courses while pursuing his research interests in computer simulation and database management.  He had additional contracts with LT&amp;T, Square D Company, Talent +, ACTON, Transcrypt, Nebraska Department of Education, Western Nebraska Community College, Lincoln Public Schools, and several departments and colleges at the University of Nebraska.</p>
<p>He served as Co-director of the Center for Communication and Information Science (Engineering Research Centers) and also as Director of the Research Computing Group. Later, he organized the structure and financing to create a private company, i2rd, which operates in Lincoln and provides software solutions to unique business software development problems.</p>
<p>Nelson devoted his academic and research career of 50 years to helping the students at the University of Nebraska, Nebraska industry, and the people of the State of Nebraska.</p> </div> </div>

<p>His most well-known books are <em>The Psychology of Computer Programming</em> and <em>Introduction to General Systems Thinking</em> both of which are considered to be classics in the field.  The latter is related to the field of work of Jay Forrester another member of the Nebraska Hall of Computing.</p>
<p>Remembering his experiences at UNL, Weinberg says:</p>
<div style="margin: 0 0 1.1em 30px;">
<p>I did physics in Brace and spent a lot of time rummaging in the attic among 19th Century physics experiments. I did my astronomy on the roof of Ferguson which presaged my work in NASA's Space program.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate, I had the honor of being the first "computer" on the UNL campus. That was my job title in the Physics Department. I used a mechanical Friden, pencil, paper, and especially erasers, to invert 10x10 matrices for researchers in the department. There never was another computer on campus during my years there.</p>
<p>I became a physics teaching assistant as a junior, and graduated third in my class with highest distinction in physics and English. My other two majors were mathematics and philosophy.</p>
<p>I was elected to Sigma Xi, Phi Beta Kappa, and Pi Mu Epsilon, and took my National Science Foundation Fellowship to Berkeley, where I still found no computers. I went to work for IBM so I could finally get my hands on a computer, the first one in San Francisco.</p>
<p>With IBM, I was a member of the team that built the world's first operating system, then came onto NASA's Mercury Project as the architect of the space tracking system which was built around the world's first multi-programmed operating system.</p>
<p>I then took my PhD from Michigan in Communication Sciences and initiated the field of human-computer interaction with my book, <em>The Psychology of Computer Programming.</em></p>
<p>I returned to Lincoln around 1970, when my wife Dani took a position in the anthropology department. I was an adjunct professor in Computer Science and also participated with Dani in the ADAPT program for experiential learning.</p>

Dillon</strong> into the Nebraska Hall of Computing.</p> </div> </div>
<div class="views-field views-field-field-inductee-bio"> <div class="field-content"> <p><strong>Donald F. Dillon</strong> was born in Alliance, Nebraska, the eighth of ten children of Tom and Katherine Dillon. He attended a one-room country school until his family moved to Alliance, where he attended a parochial grade and high school. Upon graduation from high school, he attended Regis University in Denver, Colorado, and then transferred to the University of Nebraska  – Lincoln, where he received his degree. After his graduation from college, he enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard and upon ending his active duty assignment in 1966, he went to work for the National Bank of Commerce in Lincoln, Nebraska. He started work as a computer operator, was then a programmer, systems analyst, and ultimately a Senior Vice President and Director of the Information Management.</p>
<p>In 1976, Dillon and associate, Dale Jensen, recognized that the continuing miniaturization and cost-reductions of computer hardware could make the power of the computer available to the full-range of financial institutions, from the largest to the smallest of banks. They foresaw the potential for software that could meet the needs of these institutions. The software would have to be sophisticated enough to meet the ever-increasing demands of the banking industry and would require an on-going maintenance and support system. Together, they left their banking positions and founded Information Technology, Incorporated (ITI) , which grew to become a leading national provider of banking software and services. Developing a completely new line of software systems for financial institutions allowed them to take advantage of the latest innovations in computer hardware, without being limited to the older constructs of the existing software systems. Although the original market for these products was institutions being serviced by larger banks and independent processing firms, it was not long before larger and larger institutions, including the processing firms themselves, recognized the power  and superior functionality of these systems.  Now, well over 2,700 of the U.S. banks, savings institutions and processing firms are users of ITI’s products and services.  In May of 1995, ITI was acquired by Fiserv, Inc., and Dillon became Vice Chairman and a member of the Executive Committee for that firm. In July of 2000, Dillon became Chairman of the Board of Directors for Fiserv and also continues in his position as Chairman of ITI.</p>
<p>Fiserv, Inc (NASDAQ: FISV), a Fortune 500 company, provides information management and electronic commerce systems and services to the financial and insurance industries. Headquartered in Brookfield, Wis., the company is the leading provider of core processing solutions for U.S. banks, credit unions, and thrifts. Fiserv was ranked as the largest provider of information technology services to the financial services industry worldwide in the 2004, 2005, and 2006 FinTech 100 surveys. The company serves more than 18,000 clients, including every one of the top 100 banks in the United States. In 2007, the company completed the acquisition of CheckFree, a leading provider of electronic commerce services. Fiserv reported nearly $4 billion in total revenue from continuing operations for 2007.</p>
<p>Dillon has over 40 years of experience in the financial and data processing industries.  He is a member of the Board of Trustees for the University of Nebraska Foundation; a member of the University of Nebraska’s Directors Club, a Trustee of the Nebraska State Historical Society and formerly served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees and Executive Committee Member for Doane College in Crete, Nebraska. Dillon is also a Board Member of the Dillon Foundation, which he created in 1997 and which has granted several million dollars to various humanitarian and educational organizations within the State of Nebraska.</p>
<p>In addition to his Fiserv Chairmanship, Dillon is active in various real estate and resort development activities along with investments in and support of high-tech start up companies.</p> </div> </div>
