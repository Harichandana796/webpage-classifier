Ask yourself, "What do I like to study?", "What am I good at?", "What kind of
work do I see myself doing?"  Computer Science is about problem solving, is a
highly diverse field with many career opportunities, and is a major that
prepares you for your graduate studies in other areas (e.g., law, business,
medical, engineering).

<br/><br/>

Break the stereotype about Computer Science.  Women do not suffer fro many
inherent disadvantage when it comes to studying, understanding, and applying
computer science concepts.  Far from it!  Computer Science involves much more
than programming.  In a nutshell, it's about finding interesting and innovative
ways to solve problems.
